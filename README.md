## Technical Background

The code for the coin was obtained from [Github.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTZGWFF3amRzWmJ3ZXI1bWtwX0VTRnF3NE43d3xBQ3Jtc0tsSERJR1QtOFpEOGFycE9mbzZBYkduNmhVVGRFQUVrVm9rTkpEak05dGY2TDBSQ0k0RmZtdnd1aGUzVkJVeE9PUjU2c2lQbzFwUGtmeWFTSF9zQlBHLWEyYl9yM0xXQXF4WjJmcVA4aG9JRlpfazdmUQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjklepatch%2Feattheblocks%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fscreencast%2F308-create-bep20-token-bsc%2FToken.sol) It took a second to copy and paste and the code was fully usable. I only had to add the name for the token and the number of tokens I wish to make, which further proves the point that anyone can build their own cryptocurrency. The process of making this token can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6shRPixqVY&t=506s)
